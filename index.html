                <p class="bio-text">
                    Hello, my name is Elaine! I am a third year computer engineering student at Simon Fraser University.
                    I've previously worked at a startup company called Healthcare Systems R&A in Montreal as a software development and machine learning engineer
                    where I was able to work on an RDT strip concentration project (scroll down for more info)!
                    In the future I hope to work with more embedded systems and hardware related content because I love hands on work.
                    My hobbies are reading, listening to music, playing volleyball and lifting heavy weights!

            <p class="sec-text">I am a caffeine addict! Outside of school, I am a barista. I love the cafe environment and the smell of coffee
                and I definitely get more productive in a cafe setting.<br><br>I'm a competitive, active person and love to push
                myself to my limits. I have adopted the habit of going to the gym at least 4x a week and love the thrill of
                lifting heavy weights. Also I play volleyball!<br><br>In my spare time, I read books to relax. Fantasy is very enjoyable
                to read but lately I have been getting into a lot of self-development books. Some books I highly recommend is
                Rich Dad Poor Dad by Robert Kiyosaki and Think and Grow Rich by Napoleon Hill.</p>

        <h1 class="p-text">My Co-op experience</h1>

        <div class="cards">
            <p class="sec-text">I was given the opportunity to relocate to Montreal, Quebec to further my learning and work as a software
                development and machine learning engineer for a startup company called Healthcare Systems R&A Inc. The 
                company itself has many different projects and utilizes many machine learning and artificial intelligence
                concepts to enhance small companies.<br><br>The project I worked on was called RDT Imaging. The problem is that rapid diagnostic tests (RDT) are used as
                a method to provide a rapid and effective way to diagnose certain diseases on the presence of certain
                antibodies, proteins and analyte concentrations of interest. However, many times RDT's result in faint lines
                and are therefore misinterpreted.<br><br>The solution was to create a computer assisted diagnosis software that can target the issue of misreading RDTs.
                Therefore, the aim of the project was to create an automatic reader that can read tests irrespective of the
                company and not be image specific or test specific and provides the concentration of the analyte tested. To
                achieve this, many different machine learning concepts and different image processing techniques were used
                to achieve more accurate results and have a decreased error rate.<br><br><br>(Images from my project below!)</p>
